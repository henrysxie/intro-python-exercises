## String Concatentation

1. Set a variable called `name` equal to your full name.

2. Set a variable called `first_name` equal to your first name.

3. Set a variable called `last_name` equal to your last name.

4. Then combine `first_name` and `last_name` so that it equals your full name, and save this in a variable called `full_name`.

5. Prove using the == operator that they are equal.

6. Get the length of your name. (Google which operator to use)


## String Interpolation

1. Create a string with placeholders for your first and last name.

2. Interpolate the string template with `first_name` and `last_name`

3. Create a new string template such that `template.format(name)` returns "Hello, Charles!"

4. Modify the string template to take an arbitrary greeing instead of always saying "Hello"
